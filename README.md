# Encryption-Decryption-Tool
This project will allow the user to encrypt and decrypt a file using a password-based encryption scheme with the AES encryption algorithm. The user will provide a file to encrypt or decrypt, along with a password, and the program will use the PyCryptodome library to encrypt or decrypt the file using the AES algorithm with the provided password.
